# First seen early 2025, persisting across both X11 and Wayland, with all the
# multithreading tests. Example: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/jobs/84352269
# Fails with SEGV.

# the array tests take us down with a fault:
# panfrost ff9a0000.gpu: js fault, js=0, status=INSTR_INVALID_PC
# ... and the random tests presumably include some array in with them
# flake the lot until it's been root-caused; first seen around 2025-05-07
