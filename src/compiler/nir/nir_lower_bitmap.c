/* Lower glBitmap().
 *
 * This is based on the logic in st_get_bitmap_shader() in TGSI compiler.
 * From st_cb_bitmap.c:
 *
 *    glBitmaps are drawn as textured quads.  The user's bitmap pattern
 *    is stored in a texture image.  An alpha8 texture format is used.
 *    The fragment shader samples a bit (texel) from the texture, then
 *    discards the fragment if the bit is off.
 *
 *    Note that we actually store the inverse image of the bitmap to
 *    simplify the fragment program.  An "on" bit gets stored as texel=0x0
 *    and an "off" bit is stored as texel=0xff.  Then we kill the
 *    fragment if the negated texel value is less than zero.
 *
 * Note that the texture format will be, according to what driver supports,
 * in order of preference (with swizzle):
 *
 *    I8_UNORM - .xxxx
 *    A8_UNORM - .000x
 *    L8_UNORM - .xxx1
 *
 * If L8_UNORM, options->swizzle_xxxx is true.  Otherwise we can just use
 * the .w comp.
